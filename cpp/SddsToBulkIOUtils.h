/* floatingPointCompare is a helper function to handle floating point comparison

 * if lhs <  rhs: -1.0 or less
 * Recommended usage is to convert a comparison such as: (lhs OP rhs)
 * to (floatingPointCompare(lhs,rhs) OP 0), where OP is a comparison operator
 * (==, <, >, <=, >=, !=).
 * "places" is used to specify precision. The default is 1, which
